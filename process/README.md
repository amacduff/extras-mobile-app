# Process Notes

## Page 1: SWOT
We began the project with research. Each of us worked on our own separate research exercises, then shared the things we learned. I examined strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for Feed Austin, the charitable organization for which we designed the app.

## Page 2: Competitive Analysis
I researched a couple of delivery type brands to see what their strengths and weaknesses were.

## Page 3: User Stories
My partner worked up some personas, and together we worked on user stories based on their perceived needs.

## Page 4 & 5: User Flows
Using the personas and their user stories, we made user flows based on the two user groups we identified: Restaurants and Volunteers. These flows follow the path of least resistance to each user group's main goal in the app. For Restaurants, that goal was to add food and post it for pickup. For Volunteers, the goal was to find food and deliver it.

## Pages 6â€“8: Sketches
I made these rough sketches to lay out the screens needed for our wireframes. The finished wireframes can also be found in the main folder of this repository.

## Page 9: Notes for Iteration
After creating our wireframes, we revisited our user's needs and discussed with our instructor, and came up with notes for necessary changes in the next iteration of our design.
