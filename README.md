# Extras Mobile App
A group project for the UI Design course at The Iron Yard Austin. A classmate and I worked together for a client to produce a working prototype of a native mobile application called Extras. This app solves the problem of how to get surplus food from busy restaurants to charitable organizations by connecting restaurants with volunteers who can pick up and deliver this extra food.

The InVision prototype can be seen <a href="https://invis.io/MY516U6JB" target="_blank">here</a>.
